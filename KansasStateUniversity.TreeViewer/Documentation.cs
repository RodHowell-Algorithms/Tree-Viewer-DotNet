/** \mainpage KansasStateUniversity.TreeViewer2
 *
 * KansasStateUniversity.TreeViewer2 is a library for building visualizations of trees.
 * This library is a revision of KansasStateUniversity.TreeViewer, which
 * contained some members that were not consistent with the .NET style.
 * A developer may define a tree structure which implements ITree.  If colored
 * nodes are desired, a class implementing IColorizer may also be defined.
 * A drawing of the tree can then be created using the TreeDrawing, TreePanel, and/or
 * TreeForm classes.
